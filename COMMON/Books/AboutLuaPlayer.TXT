PSPKOR - I believe the WAV sound must follow a certain encoding. I think it has to be MONO and a multiple of 1000 mhz frequency or osmething (11000, 22000, 44000). Don't think thses numbers are exact, just know it does have to be a certain frequency specified by mikmod (could probably read the readme for the psp's mikmodlib and find out) 

eboot launching


Code:
static int lua_LoadExec(lua_State *L)
{
    if (lua_gettop(L) != 1) return luaL_error(L, &quot;the file path was expected&quot;);
    const char *FILEPATH = luaL_checkstring(L, 1);
    sceKernelLoadExec(FILEPATH, NULL);
    return 0;
}
i personally added this into a mod that i made so i know it works - it was in 1.50 kernel so i dont know if it will work the same for you but i think the 3.xx library has a function that does the same thing

- note i didn't release the mod so i didn't need to release the source just for those who wanted to know why

if you set it over 333 but he should put a limiter on it

these weren't coded by me but im sure that you wouldn't mind adding them in

- gets the psp's nickname

static int lua_nickName(lua_State *L)

{

    if (lua_gettop(L) != 0) return luaL_error(L, &quot;no arguments expected.&quot;);
    char *namebuffer = &quot;&quot;;

    sceUtilityGetSystemParamString(1, namebuffer, 25);
    lua_pushstring(L, namebuffer);
    return 1;

}
- exits to the xmb
static int lua_Quit(lua_State *L)
{
    if (lua_gettop(L) != 0) return luaL_error(L, &quot;no arguments expected.&quot;);
    sceKernelExitGame();
    return 0;
}
- tests to see if there is a umd drive inserted, it was to go along with umd loading but i never got it to work - umd loading that is


Code:
static int lua_UmdCheckMedium(lua_State *L)
{
    if (lua_gettop(L) != 0) return luaL_error(L, &quot;no arguments expected&quot;);

    lua_pushnumber(L, sceUmdCheckMedium(0));
    return 1;
}
